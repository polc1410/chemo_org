Here is a [link to a blog post](https://www.thedatalab.org/blog/67/high-dose-dexamethasone/), I wrote for the guys over at TheDataLab about High Dose Dexamethasone. Data Lab tells me this was one of their most read posts. I continue to keep an eye on the dexamethasone data, and in the future will post a "live" update of that data on here.
