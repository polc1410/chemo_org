If you have a small data project that needs a home, that fits our ethos and genre, get in touch.\r\nIf you have useful content that might be worth posting here - let us know.\r\nContent on this site has not been peer reviewed. It is the opinion of the author, and opinions can change or sometimes be wrong. If you spot a factual error - let us know.

The site is written in R Studio using R Markdown with the distill package. Published pages are uploaded to a private github repository (to hold a version history) and an n8n.io uses a github action to trigger a git pull on the server to download the latest version of the site. The About Me page uses the postcards packge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

However, I find Research Gate a bit tricky to navigate to find those posters sometimes. It is also more of a scientific place, and doesn’t provide somewhere to give more of a narrative approach to what the poster was trying to achieve or how it came to be.\r\nMy more recent posters follow the format of Mike Morrison’s #BetterPoster format. This video explains Mike’s theory on how scientific posters need to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
