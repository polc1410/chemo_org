The next slide will be you poll.

It is made up using DirectPoll.com.  The Results link is:

```
<iframe 
    src="https://directpoll.com/r?XDbzPBd3ixYqg8GCvsvX0jmkfhsI8NlQqP5VgKnMu", 
    width="100%", 
    height= "100%">
</iframe>
```

When the poll isn't open yet - it will show the QR code.  There is a small play and pause button at the bottom that you can use to launch the poll.

The user should see the question on their device they are using to poll with...

When you click play the QR code will disappear - so you probably need to think about how that works...  The user then sees the question, clicks their answer and submits vote.

You can ask multiple questions or have multiple polls.  

You can choose to show live results etc.
