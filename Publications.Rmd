# Posters

I usually try to publish my posters (things I wrote myself, or was a co-author on) to my [ResearchGate account](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Calum-Polwart). However, I find Research Gate a bit tricky to navigate to [find those posters](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Calum-Polwart/publications) sometimes. It is also more of a scientific place, and doesn't provide somewhere to give more of a narrative approach to what the poster was trying to achieve or how it came to be.

My more recent posters follow the format of [Mike Morrison](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbU15LUhyNm1lMmFBOXE4Y1JVU3poQXVpclZ4Z3xBQ3Jtc0trVVhjSTRYbm1KdTM1WjB6R2pvekYzbmxPY0dsWmtBYjZrWGtVWjlCUGx6VzRUeVkxVXBoMDJFTkM1WE9lTTVBUDlmVWtOeld2N3VlRG1ONjVVMFVnTG1PR0tGaXRCTVdtV1BHT3dzWkcwN3lGQjAxaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fmikemorrison)'s [\#BetterPoster](https://osf.io/ef53g/â€‹) format. This video explains Mike's theory on how scientific posters need to change.
